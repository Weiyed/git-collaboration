Hello everyone, I'm Joe Reeve. I come from Canada and
I major in computer science and peacebuilding, with a 
minor in entrepreneurship. I have been married for 3 years
and my wife is now studying here in the graphic design
program. 

For my final project, I'm going to build a workout tracker
web app. It will generate custom workout routines based
on the user's goals/experience and help them to track 
their progress. Perhaps I will also add a social element
so that you can see what workouts your friends are doing.
