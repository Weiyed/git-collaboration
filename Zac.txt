Hi, I am Zac. I am from Utah and have 1 semester left till graduation. Almost there!!
For my final I will attempt to make a news source web page that will allow users to share
and view different news articles. After creating a log in and a user profile the user will then be 
presented with some top trending news stories which they can either swipe right to save
and read later or swipe left to disregard. The home page will be populated with news
while their saved stories will be kept to either read or share with other users later.
